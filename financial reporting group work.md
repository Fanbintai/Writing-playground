## Case review:
In the case above, Joe as a chief financial officer for Withco Ltd, should not negotiate all the loan requirements in one single commercial bank, which is unethical.

Ben as the chief loans officer at The Swift Merchant Bank, which was a brokerage firm and involved in a portion of distributed IPO shares sales, handed those profitable shares to Joe in return for Withco Ltd’s long term financing business. As a result of these allocations, Joe made a fat profit by selling them on the market. 

Based on IFAC fundamental principles and ethics of a CFA, I believe Ben’s unfair allocation of shares distributed in the IPO process was unethical and his actions against public interest didn’t comply with integrity and objectivity. The ethical issues also contain unfair dealing with shares during the process of IPO.

## Standard requirement:
According to the Code of Ethics referred to in Item 406 of Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC, the Chief Executive Officer and each senior financial officer shall, at all times, conduct himself or herself in an honest and ethical manner, including the ethical handling of actual or apparent conflicts of interest between personal and professional relationships (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, 2013).  

In addition, according to Code of Ethics published by HKICPA, S.100.5, a professional accountant shall comply with the following fundamental principles:
(a)Integrity 
(b)Objectivity
(c)Professional Competence and Due Care
(d)Confidentiality
(e)Professional Behavior(Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants, 2016).

The IFAC Fundamental Principles are: 
(i) ‘A distinguishing mark of the accountancy profession is its acceptance of the responsibility to act in the public interest . . .’ (100.1). 
(ii) ‘A professional accountant shall comply with the following fundamental principles: 
.	(a)  Integrity – to be straightforward and honest in all professional and business relationships. 

.	(b)  Objectivity – to not allow bias, conflict of interest or undue influence of others to override professional or business judgements. 

CFA ethics Standard III-B: Fair Dealing
Members and Candidates must deal fairly and objectively with all clients when providing investment analysis, making investment recommendations, taking investment action, or engaging in other professional activities.

##Cases analysis:

Joe violated “Objectivity” and “Professional Behavior”.
Objectivity: The principle of objectivity imposes an obligation on all professional accountants not to compromise their professional or business judgment because of bias, conflict of interest or the undue influence of others. (S.120.1)
Professional Behavior: The principle of professional behavior imposes an obligation on all professional accountants to comply with relevant laws and regulations and avoid any action that the professional accountant knows or should know may discredit the profession.

Before Joe met with Ben, it is the practice for Withco Ltd to obtain loans from a number of merchant banks. However, due to the special relationship with Ben, classmates, Joe has make use of his position as a CFO to arrange all the loan requirements through Swift Merchant Bank, where Ben worked in. It is abnormal for a company to make all the loans through one single bank. This change indicates that their special relationship has significantly influenced Joe’s decision, which means it has impaired Joe’s objectivity and professional behavior when making the borrowing decision.

IPO allocation occurs when investors receive IPO shares. Typically, the lead underwriter, or investment bank managing the IPO, will allocate shares to brokerage firms associated with the IPO. The brokerage firms will then distribute these shares to investors. The Swift Merchant Bank, as a professional brokerage to distribute shares, is expected to obey a standard of fairness and loyalty to clients and make IPO allocation a bona fide public distribution. Those shares are supposed to allocate pro rata depending on outside investor’s demand. Given that a pro rata procedure process is not always practical, the alternative way to comply with the Standard would be to select IPO participants at random from the entire client list and to establish a cycle where everyone must participate once before being chosen again.  Ben，however,  in the case disposed a large amount of shares to Joe for his own financial interest. Unfortunately, by allocating in this manner he is violating Standard III-B—fairness with IPO allocation. 

On the other hand, one of the IFAC fundamental principles is that professional accountants should act in public interest. In the case above, Ben should have taken public investors’ interest into account not just himself, but he only reserved his own benefits and ignored his responsibility for other investors. And he also violated principles of integrity and objectivity, which does not allow bias, conflict of interest or undue influence of others to override professional or business judgements. As a Chief loan officer of a brokerage firm, Ben accepted financial interest offered by Joe and this benefit had significant influence on Ben’s later IPO shares allocation. Ben’s unethical behavior extremely impaired other investors’ trust and interest. Even worse, Ben’s behavior might be involved with risk of committing inside trading offences. 

## Potential problems:

There may be some threats under this circumstance. 

As there exist some special relationship between the CFO, who is responsible for negotiating, and the chief loans officer of the commercial bank which engaging in both the mortgage and IPO business, Joe, the CFO, may have incentives to sign unfair contract with the commercial bank in order to get personnel interest. It is apparently a kind of “conflict of interest between personal and professional relationships.” If doing so, it is decreasing the company’s profit and at the same time, sacrificing the shareholders’ interest. 

Besides, if a company’s loan is too aggregate, for example, all from one bank, it will increase the risk that the company will easily be announced bankruptcy by the bank if there incurred any liquidation problems.

The violation of profession ethics has worst impact on other investors, Ben’s bank, and the whole professional personnel. First of all, allocating more of IPO shares to related party leads to unfairness over other investors and as a result weaken these investors’ confidence in investing IPO shares.
As for banks, decreasing interest for IPO investing might pose a threat to profit of The Swift Merchant Bank and even drive away its potential customers who intend to invest through the bank. 
From the point of view of industry, unfair treatment of investors destroyed public trust in brokerage firm and many public investors will be unwilling to apply for a IPO allotment. The less interest on IPO might make it difficult for listing company to raise capital through IPO process due to investor’s lost trust in fair allocation process. 

## How to prevent:

Under S.100.13, Code of Ethics, HKICPA, safeguards are classified into two broad categories:
(a) Safeguards created by the profession, legislation or regulation; and
(b) Safeguards in the work environment.

For (a) mentioned above, CFO’s unethical behavior can be prevented and reduced by: 
(1)	Enhancing and complete the standard, legislation and regulation that related to ethical issues.
(2)	Strengthen the supervision force to make regularly review of the information that the firm produced.
(3)	Increase the educational and training threshold for being a profession.
(4)	Strengthen the punishment to impose more pressure on professions for unethical behavior.
(5)	Increase the disclosure and auditing requirement about significant changes in financing structure.

For (b) mentioned above, CFO’s unethical behavior can be prevented and reduced by: 
(1)	The company as a whole should stress the importance of compliance with the fundamental ethic principles.
(2)	The company should disclose to the public whether they have adopted a code of ethics that applies to all the directors and managers.
(3)	Improve the internal control system to reduce the chances of unethical behavior.
(4)	 Encourage the staff to report to the authorities about any unethical issues they discovered.

All procedures are expected to embed the fundamental principles of fairness and objectivity and develop procedures that avoid systematic discrimination of one group of clients in favor of another.

Some common elements must be considered when developing a fair IPO allocation process:
.		All application for IPO shares must be date and time-stamped.
.		Have a process on a first in/first out basis, based on the time stamped.
.		Block trades receive the same execution price and commission.
.		Partially executed blocks should be allocated pro rata.

For Hot IPO Issues, Obtain Indications of Interest in Advance - Allocation procedure should be systematic (e.g. pro rata, random draw) and not based on favoritism.
Do Not Withhold Shares - Refrain from holding shares in hot issues for personal accounts, leaving out any interested clients, and make a bona fide effort to publicly distribute.

All trade allocation procedures should be disclosed to clients.
Report all outside relationships that might give the appearance of a conflict (e.g. board memberships, trustee positions).
Discuss conflict of interest questions with the compliance officer and the immediate supervisor (or legal counsel, if appropriate) prior to taking any action.
